## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cheryl. My involvement in computer science stretches waaaaaaay way back, but I didn't start learning programming languages until 2010. I started *really* learning to code as a hobby in 2019, which sparked my curiosity about tech as a career. A serendipitous opportunity at North Seattle College led me back to school in 2022 for an immersive CS education, which culminated in a Bachelor of Science degree in June 2025. With a history of diverse experiences, I'm excited to apply my knowledge and skills to the next chapter of my professional life.
